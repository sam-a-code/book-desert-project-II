            <h3 className='home-box-header'>So, what is a book desert?</h3>
            <p className='home-box'>According to an article from the U.S. News & World report, book deserts are defined as areas where children and parents lack access to quality books. They are prevalent in low-income neighborhoods across the United States and can negatively impact children's literacy. From that same article â€“ "In the Kingsessing neighborhood, where 90 percent of residents lived in poverty, parents could purchase 55 different children's books at four stores, the study said. In Chestnut Hill, an affluent neighborhood, parents had a choice of 16,453 children's titles for sale at 11 stores... More books were available at public schools and libraries in the more affluent neighborhoods." <br></br> 
            <br></br> There are quite a few people and organizations who are making an impact in communities affected by a lack of books. From pop-up book give-aways to barbershops and laundromats that have free books and a quiet reading area, to vending machines that disrtibute books for free, people are finding ways to get books into the hands of children.</p>
            <h4 className='home-box-bold'>Our hope is that in addition to learning about what book deserts are and how communities are impacted by them, this also inspires you to: donate a book in your community, make a donation to one of the organizations distributing books in book deserts, or just to go and support your local library! We especially wanted to highlight @storybookmaze, who was the inspiration for this project.</h4>
